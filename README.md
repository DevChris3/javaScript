# javaScript 

I am a self-taught developer and i chose to work towards becoming a Full-Stack Developer.

Learning JavaScript has been amazing, exciting and a bit of HARD WORK. 
I used GitHub to store what i learned so that other programmers may come and learn from my repositories.

Here is where i display my code as i continue my journey to learn about JavaScript:


- Variables
- Data types
- logical operators
- if statements
- functions
- loops
- control flow



and more...
